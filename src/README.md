As a quick introduction to my project, I'll pretty much copy-paste my overview and features from the Project Outline.

### Overview
My idea for a project is a sort of musical catalog website. I plan to have a list of genres, within which will be subgenres, then bands, albums, etc. This layout is very subject to change, but I'll figure that out. Included will be descriptions of each category.
I would like for users to be able to also be able to sign in and leave reviews or recommendations on bands or albums for other users to view, and possibly comment on.
The purpose of this project will hopefully be for someone to discover something new, something they've never heard before, and possibly learn why what they've found is appealing to others if not them.
My idea came from a fascination with all things musical, especially the intricacies of what makes up a musical genre, along with the psychological connection people have with the music that they enjoy.
### Features
User Login: Users can log in and rate/comment on a band or album that they enjoyed or did not enjoy, and let others know why. They can also make recommendations for similar albums for users that enjoyed them.
Search: Recommendations would be nothing without a search function, duh.
Create Post: This one is also obvious.
Rating System: We implemented this early on in the class and I think it would be useful here.
Email: This will be the tough part - sending a confirmation email upon creation of a user account.
